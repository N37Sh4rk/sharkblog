I used to have an insane drive and motivation

no mercy

I wanted to be rich, strong, handsome, and everything that could make me a stronger opponent in the game of life

but sometimes

the desire fades away

that's what's been happening lately

and it's hard to grasp why

but it's pretty obvious

you're not hungry when you're satisfied

you don't wanna go hunt down a bison if you've just eaten pizza

that's it

dopamine

the instant gratification tricking you into thinking that you're fine

tricking you into believing that what you have is enough

when in reality, you have a deep starving hole in you

but what happens once you starve yourself from that dopamine?

for me it's clear

the hunger, the desire sneaks back and becomes louder!

Hunger and desire are what's going to drive you to greatness

it's your reason why,

it's do or die

If you want success in life, you need to want it more than anything else

that feeling of never being satisfied, always hungry for more

Instant gratification and dopamine put a silence on the desire for greatness  
because, for a moment, you feel like you have what you want already.

but deep down, you know you're missing something...

something is not right

there is an empty void inside of you

an emptiness that screams louder in the night

and even louder when you don't have instant dopamine easily available to shut it down

the problem is not the alcohol, porn, junk food, candy, or the drugs

the problem is that you have a void that needs to be filled

and you're going for the easy quick fix

You have made a great fall in the battle of life, and surgery is necessary to heal the wound, but instead, you keep overdosing on painkillers to numb it.

The painkillers wear off, and you're back where you started.

so you run back to the painkillers

something ain't right

this is not working

it's easier to fill the void with something that's instant and temporary

rather than something that's going to take a long time but will last a lifetime

if you starve yourself from that instant gratification, you only have one option available

the long-term fix

you realize that you must go through the surgery

It's going to hurt

but it's the only right answer

it's the thing that's actually going to make you the person you want to become

your true dreams and desires that have been forgotten and buried deep down under painkillers, quick fixes, and dopamine

once you starve yourself from the temptations

the hunger will sneak back to you

you may not know your true mission in life now

but if you starve yourself long enough

take in the silence

be patient

soon enough

with enough eagerness

it will come to you

eventually, it will all make sense

the hunger that's going to make you ready to fight

to fight any battle you have to go through in order to become what you truly want

your desire is back, you're back to your true self again,

it's going to be brutal,

it's going to be painful

but if nobody has told you yet

life is to be lived  
and living is painful sometimes

*ACTIONSTEP: CUT OUT THE INSTANT DOPAMINE FOR 60 DAYS, AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS*
- *pro tip 1. Change your behaviour, rather than removing them. You'll feel empty when you take away your dopamine habits, its like addictions, change porn with reading, change junkfood with healthy food*
- *pro tip 2. To change your behaviour, change your environment, cant sit down and focus on a book? Go to the library. Its hard to eat healthy? Eat at home rather than going out*
- *pro tip 3. Be patient. Change takes time, and is often painfull. It takes longer and is more painful than we can imagine, thats why 99% off people that try to change their life quit along the way before anything changes.* 

#### *EXPECT IT TO BE HARD. EXPECT IT TO TAKE A HORRIBLY LONG TIME. AND EXPECT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL THE URGE TO GIVE UP. BUT YOU WILL NOT GIVE UP BECAUSE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!*

## **GOOD LUCK!
