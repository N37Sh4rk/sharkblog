as 2024 is comming to an end I want to be clear on my goals for 2025

I believe the best way to start a year is to have a crystalclear image or vission of what you want to achieve and maybe more importantly how you want to achieve it

ive been doing this since the end of 2019 getting into 2020

but for some reason, I always fall off by february or march

not this year

im DONE with breaking my own promises

I believe a huge common mistake in setting "new year resolutions" is not being spesific enough, and not having a strong enough reason why

if your why is strong enough and you can remind yourself of it everyday

youre more likely to win

secondly

instead of wishing or hoping for x outcome

set a clear plan for the work youre going to do to get to that destination

for me

I want to build a better physique this year

instead of just going to the gym randomly and eating healthier 

I have a clear plan as to what I MUST do every day of 2025

Im signing up a subscription with a fitness coach that tells me how to train and how to eat or what to eat

and I just follow his rules EVERY DAMN DAY

this is easier said than done

but my reason WHY is that ive been trying for too long now

and I realize that trying is not going to get you there

its not enough doing your best, you have to do what *REQUIRED*

SO goal number 1: EAT, SLEEP, AND TRAIN JUST LIKE MY COACH TELLS ME TO, LIKE MY LIFE DEPENDS ON IT NO MERCY

and honestly I think thats enough

if youre having to many goals, life is going to get cluttered and youre at higher risk of falling off

I believe its better to set one big goal that 100 small ones

I also have a few internet mentors, that im listening to

there are many people I look up to, but to keep it simple, three mentors for 2025:

Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, David Goggins and Alex Hormozi

find your mentors...

and lastly

I wanna read more books, im a slow reader, but I find it more valuable to spend a good amount of time understanding one book before hopping to the next, even reading the same book multiple times

its been a hype recently speedreading 1 book a week,

thats great! But how much have you learned?

unless youre reading to change your behavior youre not actually learning

so my books for 2025:
- Outwitting The Devil by Napoleon Hill
- Mastery by Robert Greene
- How to win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie
- The Power Of Now by  Eckhart Tolle
- The Way Of The Superior Man by David Deida
- 12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson
- The Gospel of John
- Proverbs in the Bible
- We who wrestle with God by Dr. Jordan B. Peterson
- Cant Hurt Me by David Goggins

thats 9 books some ive read before, and some I havent

but ive decided that this is going to be a life changing year

reading is just a habbit im going to get used to while commuting


# the why

there are many other things I want to do

but this year will be the year of self improvement for me

getting back on the track of becoming the best version of my self

I was on a journey like this when I was 17

but ive fallen of the train and ive been left behind

now im 22 years old and nowhere close the person I imagined id be at 22 when I was 17

which is a frightening realisation, this means If I continue, Ill be 27 still not closer to the person I wish to become

so I must take action

the most important tasts for me is eating healthy, getting enough sleep, going to the gym and reading books and learning
