  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>as 2024 is comming to an end I want to be clear on my goals for 2025</p>
<p>I believe the best way to start a year is to have a crystalclear image or vission of what you want to achieve and maybe more importantly how you want to achieve it</p>
<p>ive been doing this since the end of 2019 getting into 2020</p>
<p>but for some reason, I always fall off by february or march</p>
<p>not this year</p>
<p>im DONE with breaking my own promises</p>
<p>I believe a huge common mistake in setting &ldquo;new year resolutions&rdquo; is not being spesific enough, and not having a strong enough reason why</p>
<p>if your why is strong enough and you can remind yourself of it everyday</p>
<p>youre more likely to win</p>
<p>secondly</p>
<p>instead of wishing or hoping for x outcome</p>
<p>set a clear plan for the work youre going to do to get to that destination</p>
<p>for me</p>
<p>I want to build a better physique this year</p>
<p>instead of just going to the gym randomly and eating healthier</p>
<p>I have a clear plan as to what I MUST do every day of 2025</p>
<p>Im signing up a subscription with a fitness coach that tells me how to train and how to eat or what to eat</p>
<p>and I just follow his rules EVERY DAMN DAY</p>
<p>this is easier said than done</p>
<p>but my reason WHY is that ive been trying for too long now</p>
<p>and I realize that trying is not going to get you there</p>
<p>its not enough doing your best, you have to do what <em>REQUIRED</em></p>
<p>SO goal number 1: EAT, SLEEP, AND TRAIN JUST LIKE MY COACH TELLS ME TO, LIKE MY LIFE DEPENDS ON IT NO MERCY</p>
<p>and honestly I think thats enough</p>
<p>if youre having to many goals, life is going to get cluttered and youre at higher risk of falling off</p>
<p>I believe its better to set one big goal that 100 small ones</p>
<p>I also have a few internet mentors, that im listening to</p>
<p>there are many people I look up to, but to keep it simple, three mentors for 2025:
!<img alt="Image Description" src="/images/Pasted%20image%2020241208142105.png"></p>
<p>Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, David Goggins and Alex Hormozi</p>
<p>find your mentors&hellip;</p>
<p>and lastly</p>
<p>I wanna read more books, im a slow reader, but I find it more valuable to spend a good amount of time understanding one book before hopping to the next, even reading the same book multiple times</p>
<p>its been a hype recently speedreading 1 book a week,</p>
<p>thats great! But how much have you learned?</p>
<p>unless youre reading to change your behavior youre not actually learning</p>
<p>so my books for 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outwitting The Devil by Napoleon Hill</li>
<li>Mastery by Robert Greene</li>
<li>How to win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie</li>
<li>The Power Of Now by  Eckhart Tolle</li>
<li>The Way Of The Superior Man by David Deida</li>
<li>12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson</li>
<li>The Gospel of John</li>
<li>Proverbs in the Bible</li>
<li>We who wrestle with God by Dr. Jordan B. Peterson</li>
<li>Cant Hurt Me by David Goggins</li>
</ul>
<p>thats 9 books some ive read before, and some I havent</p>
<p>but ive decided that this is going to be a life changing year</p>
<p>reading is just a habbit im going to get used to while commuting</p>
<h1 id="the-why">the why<a href="#the-why" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h1>
<p>there are many other things I want to do</p>
<p>but this year will be the year of self improvement for me</p>
<p>getting back on the track of becoming the best version of my self</p>
<p>I was on a journey like this when I was 17</p>
<p>but ive fallen of the train and ive been left behind</p>
<p>now im 22 years old and nowhere close the person I imagined id be at 22 when I was 17</p>
<p>which is a frightening realisation, this means If I continue, Ill be 27 still not closer to the person I wish to become</p>
<p>so I must take action</p>
<p>the most important tasts for me is eating healthy, getting enough sleep, going to the gym and reading books and learning</p>
